# 🧪 JARVIS Intelligence Testing & Improvement Workflow

## 📋 Overview
Comprehensive testing framework to evaluate and improve JARVIS's intelligence, reasoning, problem-solving, and code generation capabilities to compete with enterprise-level AI agents like Claude Code, Kiro CLI, and Warp Terminal.

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy
Based on enterprise AI agent best practices:
- **Agentic Testing**: Let JARVIS think and solve problems autonomously
- **Multi-dimensional Evaluation**: Test intelligence, reasoning, problem-solving, and code generation
- **Iterative Improvement**: Fix weaknesses and re-test until perfect
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Complex tasks that mirror actual usage
