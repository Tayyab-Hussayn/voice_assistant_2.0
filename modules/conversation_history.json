The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n**The Science:**\n1. **Sunlight Composition** - Sunlight contains all colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet)\n\n2. **Scattering Effect** - When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules (mainly nitrogen and oxygen)\n\n3. **Wavelength Matters** - Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) scatter more easily than longer wavelengths (red and orange)\n\n**Why Blue, Not Violet?**\n- Blue light scatters roughly 10x more than red light\n- Our eyes are actually more sensitive to blue than violet\n- Some violet light is absorbed in the upper atmosphere\n\n**"
